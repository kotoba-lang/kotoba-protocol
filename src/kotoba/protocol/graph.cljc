(ns kotoba.protocol.graph
  "Reference algebra for the two link kinds (ADR-2608145200).

  Not a network. Hosts persist nodes (L0) and the action log (L1).
  inga orders the log. This ns is the closed semantics:

    :merkle  — edge lives inside the node. Same CID + different links is
               :cid-mismatch. To add a merkle child the host hashes a
               *new* node (parent CID changes).
    :action  — Holochain CreateLink / datom assertion. Nodes stay equal.
               Only the signed log grows. Parent CID does not change.

  Hashing bytes → CID is the host's job (see kotoba.protocol.cid).
  L2 graph CID is a `chain.core/commit!` of `log-state`. This ns does
  not hash and does not depend on chain — `commit-log` takes the
  hasher as `commit-fn`:
