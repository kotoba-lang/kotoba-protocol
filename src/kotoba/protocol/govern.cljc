  "Authorization plane: who may write overlay (ADR-2608145800 tick 2).

  Server hostname is not authority. Keys write. Governor decides.
  A denied write never reaches the action log. This ns does not
  verify CACAO signatures — crypto lives in cacao / kotoba-auth.
  The shape is enough to fail closed:

    author = graph-owner, no cacao     → allow (depth-1 self mint)
    author = graph-owner, depth ≠ 1    → deny
    author ≠ graph-owner               → deny (foreign chain)
    governor-fn is nil                 → deny (not allow)
    host string as author              → deny :not-a-key

  Overlay only. Merkle rewrite is never a governed write — that is
  a CID lie (`graph/put-node` `:cid-mismatch`)."
