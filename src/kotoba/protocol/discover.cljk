  A record does not change the CID. Putting a provider is not a merkle
  rewrite and not an overlay edge between entries.

  `advertise` / `lookup` are the in-memory algebra.
  `lookup-live` binds `(fn [cid] (kad.routing/find-providers http-fn cid opts))`.
  `advertise-live` production putter is
  `(fn [rec] (ipni.advertise http-fn rec opts))` (io-ipni-specs).
  `kad.routing/provide` remains the historic Bitswap PUT; it is not
  kotobase's production write. This ns requires neither kad nor ipni.
  Do not put IPNI into the public URI."

  "Add a provider record to `idx` under `(key-fn (:cid rec))`.

  `key-fn` is REQUIRED, and that is the point of this arity. Keying a provider
  index is a decision, and this namespace used to make it silently by keying on
  the CID string -- which disagrees with the network it describes. IPNI indexes
  a MULTIHASH: the same bytes addressed as raw and as dag-cbor are two CIDs and
  one location question, so a CID-keyed index answers `no providers` for
  content it is holding providers for. Nothing here had ever tested that case;
  the test that looked like it (`ipni-record-does-not-mutate-cid`) uses two
  fixtures whose digests differ, so it asserts only that an unrelated CID finds
  nothing.

  Two keyings, stated rather than defaulted:

      identity                        key by CID -- codec-sensitive
      #(vec (mf/cid->multihash %))    key by content -- what IPNI does

  `key-fn` must return a VALUE. A multihash comes back as a byte array, which
  hashes by identity, so two equal digests would be two keys; `vec` is not
  decoration.

  The same `key-fn` must be used for `lookup`. Mixing them does not error, it
  answers wrongly -- the same contract `datalog.index` states for `ref?`, and
  for the same reason: there is no default that is safe to fall back on
  silently.

  Neither keying rewrites the record: `:cid` stays exactly as advertised, so a
  digest-keyed lookup can still be filtered by codec afterwards. The index is a
  location answer, never an identity."
