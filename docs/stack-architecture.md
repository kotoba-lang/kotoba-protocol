# kotoba-protocol: stack integration

Status: accepted architecture direction, 2026-10-10. This document and
[composition metadata](../spec/stack-integration.edn) describe ownership and
future boundaries; they do not change runtime schemas or certify migration.

## Responsibility

Owns the orthogonal communication planes and L0–L5 data model, not sockets, a DHT runtime, persistent DB or a consensus implementation. Holochain-inspired agent history/integrity, IPFS/IPLD content/distribution and EVM-inspired deterministic execution/order are composed at explicit boundaries. Missing validation dependencies are unresolved, never accepted by fallback. Policy governance retains explicit decentralized consensus domains.

## Contract dependency direction

Arrows are consumer → contract dependency. These are intended entrypoint
boundaries, not whole-repository imports already achieved.

The measured selected-owner production dependencies at base `fd6a0c0fc66803e5693486eb741c9d508c129ff5`
are none among the selected 13 owners.
This selection excludes other libraries; alias-only build/test imports remain
separate in the [full observation](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/kotoba-lang/blob/main/lang/stack-dependency-observation.edn).

Target, host, distribution and consistency are independent selection axes; their
Cartesian product is not a support matrix. Unknown/unqualified profiles fail
closed. Preserve existing wire keys, CID rules and reader compatibility until
a versioned migration. Migrate whole components and public closures; Q9 is
JVM-free. Qualify actual artifacts, denied paths, limits and receipts per
target × host × operation × consistency.

Keep source dependencies, artifact flow, runtime composition and service
relationships separate. No readiness follows for debugger/live editing, heap
image restoration, selfhost, C-free production or physical hardware.
