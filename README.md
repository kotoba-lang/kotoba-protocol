# Kotoba Protocol

The normative ownership map and executable algebra for Kotoba's sovereign,
content-addressed application and data stack. It is spec-first, portable
`.cljc`, and has zero runtime dependencies.

This repository owns declarations, pure validation, and tests. Implementations
live in focused sibling repositories. It does **not** open sockets, run a DHT,
persist a database, hash graph commits, or verify CACAO signatures. Those
boundaries are deliberate: drift between the declared model and its consumers
must become visible in tests rather than creating a second implementation here.

Architecture decisions: ADR-2607071500, ADR-2608145100, ADR-2608145200, and
ADR-2608145800 in the [`com-junkawasaki/root`](https://github.com/com-junkawasaki/root)
superproject.

## Start here

The five-stage hash-addressed object network is a path through the larger model:

```text
identity        content hash / CID          docs/identity.md
    ↓
structure       DAG / two link kinds        docs/content-protocol.md
    ↓
mutable name    ref / IPNS / branch         docs/naming.md
    ↓
discovery       DHT / IPNI / gossip         docs/discovery.md
    ↓
transport       TCP / QUIC / WebRTC / Tor   docs/transport.md
```

A path is never identity at any stage. The canonical public resource forms are
`ipfs://{cidv1-base32}` for immutable identity and `ipns://{k51}` for a mutable,
key-derived name. HTTPS is a retrieval location, not proof that two resources
are identical.

## Eight orthogonal planes

The communication planes are orthogonal to the L0-L5 data ladder. URL, DNS,
HTTP, Git, package-manager, and RPC concerns must not be collapsed into one
Merkle DAG.

| Plane | Contract | Algebra | Live seam |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| identity | [Identity](docs/identity.md) | ready | n/a |
| naming | [Naming](docs/naming.md) | ready | ready |
| routing | [Routing](docs/routing.md) | ready | ready |
| discovery | [Discovery](docs/discovery.md) | ready | ready |
| transport | [Transport](docs/transport.md) | ready | blocked on a DHT-node transport |
| session | [Mux and head](docs/mux-and-head.md) | ready | blocked on transport |
| authorization | [Who may write](docs/who-may-write.md) | ready | n/a |
| content protocol | [Content protocol](docs/content-protocol.md) | ready | n/a |

`ready` for a live seam means the pure protocol accepts an injected adapter; it
does not mean this process has become a network node. The machine-readable
authority is `kotoba.protocol.layers/planes`, `link-kinds`, and
`plane-maturity`.

## L0-L5 data ladder

| Layer | Responsibility | Implementation owners |
|---|---|---|
| L0 address | bytes to CID | `io-multiformats`, `io-ipld`, `dag-cbor` |
| L1 fact | append-only datoms, including overlay edges | `datom` |
| L2 graph | ordered action log and committed graph CID | `chain`, `kotobase-peer`, `prolly-tree`, `mst`, `arrangement` |
| L3 authority | `did:key`, key-derived IPNS, CACAO write authority | `cacao`, `kotoba-auth`, `tech-ipfs-specs-ipns` |
| L4 distribution | retrieval, pinning, B2 offload, provider discovery, IPNS publish/resolve | `kotobase`, `ipfs-pinner`, `io-libp2p-specs-kad-dht` |
| L5 application | actor execution, app manifests, appviews, embeds | `kototama`, `wasm-webcomponent`, this repository |

The L2 graph CID is supplied by an injected `chain.core/commit!`-shaped
function. `kotoba-protocol` does not hash it. An archive `Location` may be the
raw CID of the same bytes, while the graph identity CID may use another codec;
codec choice does not turn a location into identity.

## Two link kinds

The model preserves both forms instead of pretending they are interchangeable:

| Kind | Stored in | Parent CID | Analogues |
|---|---|---|---|
| `:merkle` | block content | changes | IPLD link, Git tree, Nix closure |
| `:action` | signed metadata | unchanged | Holochain CreateLink, datom assertion, IPNS pointer |

Adding a Merkle child produces a new parent object and therefore a new parent
CID. Adding an action/overlay edge advances the ordered action log while the
referenced object remains unchanged. `kotoba.protocol.graph` makes this
distinction executable and rejects a different body or link set under the same
CID with `:cid-mismatch`.

## Executable surface

- `kotoba.protocol.layers` — layers, planes, link kinds, ownership, maturity
- `kotoba.protocol.ref` — strict `ipfs://` and `ipns://` public references
- `kotoba.protocol.cid` — CIDv1/sha2-256 parsing and digest comparison; no hashing
- `kotoba.protocol.address` — output- versus input-addressed identity
- `kotoba.protocol.graph` — Merkle nodes, overlay actions, walks, log commits
- `kotoba.protocol.surfaces` — URL/DNS/HTTP/Git/package/RPC plane projections
- `kotoba.protocol.discover` — provider-record algebra and injected discovery
- `kotoba.protocol.route` — peer lookup without rewriting the requested peer ID
- `kotoba.protocol.naming` — IPNS lookup/publish without rewriting the name
- `kotoba.protocol.govern` — fail-closed overlay-write admission
- `kotoba.protocol.transport` — multiaddr hops; deliberately no socket dialer
- `kotoba.protocol.mux` — authenticated stream and causal head as separate coordinates
- `kotoba.protocol.vocab` — `:kotoba.actor/*`, `:kotoba.graph/*`, `:kotoba.app/*`, and `:kotoba.link/*`
- `kotoba.protocol.app` — signed, history-bearing L5 app manifests and capability requests
- `kotoba.protocol.bridge` — host-mediated capability messages for embedded apps

The naming, routing, and discovery live functions normalize injected adapter
results and fail closed on identity mismatches. Transport and session live
operations return named blocked states; they do not fake network maturity.

## Repository boundaries

- [`kotoba-lang/kotoba-lang`](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/kotoba-lang) owns the language specification, grammar, public CLI contract, and conformance.
- [`kotoba-lang/kotoba`](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/kotoba) owns the installable CLI, runtime/host implementations, providers, and integration qualification.
- [`kotoba-lang/kotobase`](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/kotobase) owns the persistent Datalog and content-addressed database.
- [`kotoba-lang/kototama`](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/kototama) owns component admission and capability binding at execution.
- [`kotoba-lang/atprotocol`](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/atprotocol) is an AT Protocol projection over this model, not this repository's core.
- `io-libp2p-specs-kad-dht`, `io-libp2p-specs-transport`, `noise`, `cacao`, and `tech-ipfs-specs-ipns` own their focused network or cryptographic implementations.

## Development

```bash
clojure -M:test
clojure -M:lint
```

The test suite is the executable drift detector for the declared boundaries.
New behavior should strengthen a named plane or layer without importing a
network runtime into this repository.
